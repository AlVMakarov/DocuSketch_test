# DocuSketch_test
This is a test project.

The project was created using Poetry, and a requirements.txt file was automatically generated.

The plots directory saves figures generated by the main script (in this case - Notebook.ipynb).

draw_plot() is an object in the drawplots module. It should be imported before using it.
